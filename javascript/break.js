JavaScript Break and Continue


The Break Statement
    You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch() statement.

    The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop


The Continue Statement
    The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop
