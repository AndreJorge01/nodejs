Intersection Types

interfaces allowed us to build up new types from other types by extending them.
TypeScript provides another construct called intersection types that is mainly used to combine existing object types.

/*

Interfaces vs. Intersections
    We just looked at two ways to combine types which are similar,
    but are actually subtly different. With interfaces, 
    we could use an extends clause to extend from other types, and we were able to do something similar with intersections and name the result with a type alias.
    The principle difference between the two is how conflicts are handled,
      and that difference is typically one of the main reasons why youâ€™d pick one over the other between an interface and a type alias of an intersection type.
